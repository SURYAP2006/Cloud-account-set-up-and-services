# Ex.1 Cloud Account Setup and Services Overview in Microsoft Azure

## Aim:

To create a cloud account in Microsoft Azure and to explore its services such as Compute, IoT, and Security.

## Procedure:

Step 1: Go to the Azure Website

•	Visit https://azure.microsoft.com
•	Click on “Start free” or “Free account” in the top right corner.

Step 2: Sign Up with Microsoft Account

•	If you already have a Microsoft account (Outlook/Hotmail), sign in.
•	Otherwise, create a new Microsoft account using your email.

Step 3: Enter Account Information

•	Provide your basic details such as name, country/region, phone number, and verification details.

Step 4: Identity Verification

•	Enter your mobile number and verify using OTP (SMS or call).

Step 5: Select Support Plan

•	Choose the Basic Support Plan (Free) for beginners.

Step 6: Complete Sign-Up

•	Review details and click Sign Up.
•	You’ll receive a confirmation email and your Azure account will be activated.

Step 7: Sign In to Azure Portal

•	Go to https://portal.azure.com
•	Sign in with your Microsoft account.
•	This is the main dashboard where you can explore all Azure services.

Create a User with Administrative Access (Azure Active Directory):

Secure your Azure account root user

•	Sign in to the Azure Portal as the account owner.
•	Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your account.
Create a new administrative user

•	Go to Azure Active Directory (AAD) → Users → New User.
•	Assign a username and set a temporary password.
•	Under Roles, assign Global Administrator or Owner role.
Sign in as the administrative user

•	Use the newly created credentials to sign in.
•	Change the password on first login.
•	Now use this admin account for everyday tasks (instead of root).

Services Overview in Azure:

Azure provides 200+ cloud services. In this experiment, we focus on the following key categories:

1.	Compute Services

•	Azure Virtual Machines (VMs): On-demand Windows/Linux servers.
•	Azure App Services: Hosting web applications without managing infrastructure.
•	Azure Functions: Serverless compute that runs event-driven code.

2.	IoT Services

•	Azure IoT Hub: Central messaging hub for secure communication between IoT applications and devices.
•	Azure IoT Central: Simplified IoT app platform for rapid deployment.
•	Azure Digital Twins: Model real-world environments digitally.
3.	Security Services

•	Microsoft Defender for Cloud: Protects cloud resources from threats.
•	Key Vault: Securely stores and manages secrets, keys, and certificates.
•	Sentinel: Cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution.
